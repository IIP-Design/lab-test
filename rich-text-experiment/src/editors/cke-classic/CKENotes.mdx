### What formatting options (ex. headings, lists, bold, italics) are available out of the box?

Here is an array with the defaults: `["selectAll", "undo", "redo", "bold", "italic", "blockQuote", "imageTextAlternative", "link", "ckfinder", "uploadImage", "imageUpload", "heading", "imageStyle:full", "imageStyle:side", "indent", "outdent", "numberedList", "bulletedList", "mediaEmbed", "insertTable", "tableColumn", "tableRow", "mergeTableCells"]`.

A full list of options and documentation can be found on the [features page](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/index.html).

### Does it support content blocks? If so, how does one configure them?

CKEditor has several different types of editors: Classic, Inline, Balloon block, Balloon, Document, or Custom. They have an [interactive examples page](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/examples/index.html) that demonstrates each of these editors.

I implemented the Classic editor above since it's the most similar to our mockups, but the Balloon block editor seems like it could meet our needs for content blocks.

Also, they have a couple tutorials on [implementing a block widget](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/framework/guides/tutorials/implementing-a-block-widget.html) and [using a React component in a widget](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/framework/guides/tutorials/using-react-in-a-widget.html) that seem like they'd be useful for developing content blocks.
  
### How is data stored/saved?

Stores data as a string of HTML content, which would work well with the `DocumentConversionFormat` used on the Commons server.
  
### Can we manipulate the editor styling?

Yes, via a stylesheet.

### Is it extensible (can we add custom styles, toolbar buttons, blocks, etc.)?

It's relatively easy to customize which formatting options appear in the toolbar via its `config` prop.

Alternatively, they provide an online builder to create custom builds. Basically, you select various formatting options and then export a `ckeditor5` folder.

Place the custom minified build file somewhere in the app and import it in our `TextEditor` component and use it as the `CKEditor` component's `editor` prop.

Then use the configuration object in the provided `sample/index.html` file as the `config` prop.

This is the approach that I used for the classic editor; it's quick and dirty for this test. However, a better workflow might be to set up the provided custom build directory as a gpa-lab npm package that can be imported into a project as a dependency.

There also appears to be a way to replace their toolbar icons with our own. The method they suggest involves [using Webpack's `NormalModuleReplacementPlugin`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/builds/guides/faq.html#how-to-customize-the-ckeditor-5-icons).

They document a way to [create custom plugins](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/framework/guides/creating-simple-plugin.html) that appears like it could meet our needs

See comment above about implementing block widget and using React component in a block widget.

### How does it handle preformatted text?

It handles preformatted text very well. They provide a sample Word document with a heading, unordered list, text, and a table, and brought over all of the formatting correctly. I tried it with a link, and it handled that as well.

They have separate plugins for pasting from Word, Google Docs, and plain text, but pasting from Word worked for me by default.

### Miscellaneous

[Supports entering text with markdown](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/autoformat.html#block-formatting) by default.

Has pretty good [keyboard support](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/keyboard-support.html).

Overall, CKEditor is quite powerful and complex to fully grasp and set up. It seems to be professionally developed and maintained actively and has documentation that's fairly extensive and generally clear. I think this is because they sell commerical licenses for their editor in addition open source, which provides them with a source of revenue to support their work.
