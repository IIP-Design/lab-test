      He must submit his passport form in person and show ID because it is his first passport. Anyone applying for their first passport is required to submit the application in person. Thousands of local facilities around the United States, like post offices and libraries, are approved by the Department of State to accept <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/need-passport/apply-in-person.html#:~:text=You%20must%20apply%20in%20person,you%20were%20under%20age%2016" target="_blank">in-person passport applications</a>. They offer you a convenient place to apply in person, but they do not print the passport onsite. They are trained to take your application and send the application to the Department of State, which adjudicates the application, then prints and mails you your passport after a number of weeks.

      U.S. citizens traveling abroad sometimes lose their passports. When they do, they can get a temporary replacement (which will be valid for one year) from the U.S. Embassy  or the nearest U.S. Consulate.

      A U.S. Embassy is located in the capital city of a foreign country, whereas a consulate functions as a U.S. Embassy’s satellite office in other cities.

(Did you know that there are currently almost 1 million international students attending U.S. colleges and universities?)

So the State Department’s marketing of U.S. schools boosts the competitiveness of these institutions while also creating more employment within the United States.
