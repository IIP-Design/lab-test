      <p class="question">Luke just proposed to Rachel! The happy couple is enjoying a champagne toast while planning an international honeymoon trip. A reggae festival in Jamaica? Surfing the waves on Brazilian beaches? Visiting the Louvre Museum? Touring Egypt’s pyramids? A safari in Tanzania?<br><br>
    To help them decide, Luke:</p>

      <p class="explanation">The correct answer is A. (But B, reading art history books, is not a bad idea.) <br><br>The Department of State regularly <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories.html/">updates its advisories</a> to help travelers know where it is safe to travel, where to exercise extra caution, and countries to avoid.</p>

      <p class="question">Luke likes cities, where he hopes they can enjoy art galleries, museums and fine dining, and Rachel likes outdoor adventure and scenery. The couple will travel to Argentina and visit
    museums in Buenos Aires, wineries in Mendoza and southernmost terrain of Patagonia.<br>
    First, Luke needs a passport. Rachel doesn’t need to get one because:</p>
      <button class="answer" onclick="checkAnswer(this)" data-correct="false">Rachel was born overseas, so she can travel without a passport.</button>
      <button class="answer" onclick="checkAnswer(this)" data-correct="true">Rachel was issued one six years ago at age 18.</button>
      <button class="answer" onclick="checkAnswer(this)" data-correct="false">Rachel was issued one nine years ago at age 15.</button>
      <button class="answer" onclick="checkAnswer(this)" data-correct="false">Rachel is related to a U.S. senator.</button>
      <p class="explanation">The correct answer is B.<br><br>If Rachel was issued a passport six years ago, when she was age 22, it would be valid for travel today. <br><br>
    A new passport is valid for 10 years from the date of issuance, <b>if</b> you’re at least 16 years old
    when you receive it. Under 16? Your new passport is valid for only 5 years. (In the
    situation described in C, Rachel would be holding an expired passport.) <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/passport-help/faqs.html">See more information here.</a></p>
